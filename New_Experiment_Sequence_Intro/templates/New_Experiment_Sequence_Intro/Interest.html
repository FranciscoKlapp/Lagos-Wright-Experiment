        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<b>Producers</b> produce some amount and sell it at the market price

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; You had <b>{{player.tokens_end}} Tokens</b>, and received <b style="color:red">{{player.interest}} Tokens</b> ({{interest_rate}}%) as interest for them, but everyone had to pay the tax of <B style="color:red">{{subsession.lump_sum}} Tokens </B> so now you have <b>{{player.tokens_end_lump}} Tokens </b>
<br>
<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; And you also currently have  <b>{{payoff_aux}} Points</b>
<br>

Remember that the total amount of <b>Tokens</b> in this economy is always constant at <b>{{supply}}</b>
